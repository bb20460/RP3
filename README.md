# RP3: SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTING PROXIES OF RADIATION ANOMALIES AT NUCLEAR FACILITIES: PROCESSING PROCEDURES

The research project aimed to investigate satellite remote sensing techniques for continuous monitoring of nuclear facilities, with a primary emphasis on outgoing longwave radiation, thermal infrared imagery, and structural defect assessment using machine learning techniques and visual imagery. The codebase developed for this project includes code that generates relevant figures based on the research findings, serving as a starting point for further exploration towards an analytics-based platform. The main focus for future research is to create a comprehensive platform that integrates all the data into a user-friendly frontend, allowing companies to evaluate ESG metrics and the condition of nuclear facilities.

Notebooks have been provided for the figure generations, images and respective geojson files for each case study have been provided for ease of replication/interest. As of 19/04/2023, the datasets are accessible and provide the results obtained.
